            I am the co-founder and CTO of Promptfoo, where we're building
            open-source tools to evaluate, find, and fix vulnerabilities in
            LLMs. Before Promptfoo, I was the VP of Engineering at SmileID,
            where I led the development of tools that have helped over 170
            million people in Africa gain access to financial services. I also
            co-founded Arthena and Matroid.<br />In my spare time, I enjoy
            investing in people and ideas through a small venture fund, focusing
            on projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful
            to you or your cause, or if you're interested in collaborating, feel
            free to get in touch.

            <ol>
              <li>
                My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1993 when I was 3. It
                was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street
                Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical
                keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know
                what pressing the turbo button really did.
              </li>
              <li>
                We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it
                from a floppy disk onto our brand-new Packard Bell. It took
                years for me to send my first email.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased MegaRace from Media
                Play and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have
                endangered her business by using her computer too much.
              </li>
              <li>
                At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I
                also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.
              </li>
              <li>
                At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera
                after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10
                images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it,
                and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now
                with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.
              </li>
              <li>
                At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our
                Pentium III Gateway. My website was terrible.
              </li>
              <li>
                I was 11 when I built my first Tesla Coil (without my parents'
                permission). Over the next few years, I built several more,
                including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the
                first DRSSTCs.
